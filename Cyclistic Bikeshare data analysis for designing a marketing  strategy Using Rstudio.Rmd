This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)   

#### **1) INTRODUCTION:**

* This is my capstone project for the google data analytics                  professional certificate course in coursera. 
* Here i am given a fictional  cyclistic bikeshare company, but the data is the replica of a very similar real world comapany though the data is not accurate due to privacy policy issues.
* I am going to follow the analysis steps which i was learned in this course. 
* The 6 step analysis process are;
    + Ask
    + Prepare
    + Process
    + Analyse
    + Share
    + Act

<br>

#### **2) ASK:**
    
+ **Buisness Task:**
    - As per the financial analyst team increasing the membership riders        will be best for the future growth  of our company rather than            increasing the  casual riders 
    - So  the main objective of this analysis is to help the maeketing team       to come up with a marketing strategy for converting the casual riders       into an annual membership riders
+ **Key stakeholders:**
    - Cyclistic Riders
    - Lily moreno- marketing director and manager
    - Cyclistic marketing team
    - Cyclistic executive team
+ **Deliverable:**
    - My task is to identify  how the casual riders are different from           membership riders

<br>

#### **3) PREPARE AND PROCESS :** 

I am doing the prepare and process phase of this analysis simultaneously together. Because either way as i move on ,i will overlap these two phases so to avoid any further confusions i am doing it together.

* **Data source:**
    + The data i am using in this analysis is downloaded from this [tripdata webiste](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)

* **Data stored format:**
    +  The data was stored in the csv(comma separated values) format.

* **Data filtered:**
    + I am using the last 12 months data from Jan 2022 - Dec 2022
  
* **Data integrity and credibility(**ROCCC**):**
    + The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under       this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).
    +  The data is not completely ROCCC because we are using the proxy data       for this fictional company but it is almost ROCCC, it is                   **reliable**, since it is **proxy** it is similar to **original** ,        **not comphrehensive** but it is **enough** to make our analysis, it       is **current** and it is **cited** 

* **Data limitations:**
    + This is public data that we can use to explore how different customer       types are using Cyclistic bikes. 
    + But note that data-privacy issues prohibit us from using riders’           personally identifiable information.  
    + so i won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers        to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or        if they have purchased multiple single passes.
* **Tools used:**
    + I am using R programming for this analysis as it is more efficient         and statistically friendly tool to do our anlaysis.

##### **a) DATA ACQUISTION :**
* Installing and loading the required packages for doing the data            cleaning,   data manipulation , data analysis and data visualization.

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r}
library(lubridate)
library(readr)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
install.packages("janitor")
library(janitor)
install.packages("skimr")
library(skimr)
```

##### **b) IMPORTING THE FILES:**

* Now i  want to access the package, so i am  using the read_csv
 function from read_r to import it we can also use the files tab in 4th     pane to import it and  in some cases we  can also use read_xl for excel    files.

```{r}
Jan_2022 = read_csv("202201-divvy-tripdata.csv")
Feb_2022 = read_csv("202202-divvy-tripdata.csv")
Mar_2022 = read_csv("202203-divvy-tripdata.csv")
Apr_2022 = read_csv("202204-divvy-tripdata.csv")
May_2022 = read_csv("202205-divvy-tripdata.csv")
Jun_2022 = read_csv("202206-divvy-tripdata.csv")
Jul_2022 = read_csv("202207-divvy-tripdata.csv")
Aug_2022 = read_csv("202208-divvy-tripdata.csv")
Sep_2022 = read_csv("202209-divvy-publictripdata.csv")
Oct_2022 = read_csv("202210-divvy-tripdata.csv")
Nov_2022 = read_csv("202211-divvy-tripdata.csv")
Dec_2022 = read_csv("202212-divvy-tripdata.csv")
```
<br>

##### **c) CHECKING THE CONSISTENCY OF THE FILES:**
 * Now we want to combine all the files into a single dataset for             processing the data for analysis. Before combining we want  to ensure      that the data is consistent and clean .

 *  Here i am using colnames() function to make sure the coulumn names are     same through all the files.

```{r}
colnames(Jan_2022) == colnames(Feb_2022)
```
```{r}
colnames(Feb_2022) == colnames(Mar_2022)
```
```{r}
colnames(Mar_2022) == colnames(Apr_2022)
```
```{r}
colnames(Apr_2022) == colnames(May_2022)
```

```{r}
colnames(May_2022) == colnames(Jun_2022)
```
```{r}
colnames(Jun_2022) == colnames(Jul_2022)
```
```{r}
colnames(Jul_2022) == colnames(Aug_2022)
```

```{r}
colnames(Aug_2022) == colnames(Sep_2022)
```
```{r}
colnames(Sep_2022) == colnames(Oct_2022)
```
```{r}
colnames(Oct_2022) == colnames(Nov_2022)
```
```{r}
colnames(Nov_2022) == colnames(Dec_2022)
```
##### **d) ENSURING THE FILES IS BINDABLE TOGETHER:**

* As Column names are consistent , now we have to bind the data , as the     data elements or observations  we need to access are in rows before        binding we have to ensure or  inspect the rows data format is consistent   or not .

```{r}
compare_df_cols_same(Jan_2022,Feb_2022,Mar_2022,Apr_2022,May_2022,Jun_2022,Jul_2022,Aug_2022,Sep_2022,Oct_2022,Nov_2022,Dec_2022, bind_method = c("bind_rows","rbind"), verbose = TRUE )
```
##### **e) COMBINING THE MONTHLY FILES INTO ANNUAL DATA:**

* As the Above result is true now we can bind the rows together .
combining the monthly datasets into a single annual dataset

```{r}
trip_2022 = bind_rows(Jan_2022,Feb_2022,Mar_2022,Apr_2022,May_2022,Jun_2022,Jul_2022,Aug_2022,Sep_2022,Oct_2022,Nov_2022,Dec_2022)
```
##### **f) DATA WRANGLING AND DATA CLEANING:**
* **structure of dataset:**
    + Now i Have to process the data by data wrangling so to proceed with        we have to know the structure or Format of the dataset, How the data       elements are stored in it. By using he str we can get the detailed         preview of the dataset.

```{r}
str(trip_2022)
```
* **Formatting or transforming the data:**
    + After going through the structure of the dataset first thing i have        to get the date, month, year, day, and day of the week in order to         make the analysis efficiently.

    + Before doing that i am **dropping the null** values in dataset

```{r}
trip_2022 = drop_na(trip_2022)
```

```{r}
trip_2022$date = as.Date(trip_2022$started_at)
trip_2022$month = format(trip_2022$date,"%m")
trip_2022$year = format(trip_2022$date,"%Y")
trip_2022$day = format(trip_2022$date,"%d")
trip_2022$day_of_week =format(trip_2022$date, "%A")
```
* **Viewing:**
* To ensure that everything goes well lets view the data.
```{r}
View(trip_2022)
```
* **Calculating the ride distance and duration:**

    + Now we want to calculate the **ride duration**.
```{r}
trip_2022$ride_duration =difftime(trip_2022$ended_at,trip_2022$started_at)
```
* Lets check how it is stored 
```{r}
str(trip_2022$ride_duration)
```
* To perform calculations we need to **convert into numeric**

```{r}
trip_2022$ride_duration = as.numeric(trip_2022$ride_duration)

is.numeric((trip_2022$ride_duration))
```

* Now we want to calculate the  **ride distance.** 

```{r}
install.packages("geosphere")
library(geosphere)
```

```{r}
trip_2022$ride_distance =                                         distGeo(matrix(c(trip_2022$start_lng,trip_2022$start_lat), 
                                       ncol = 2)  ,
 matrix(c(trip_2022$end_lng,trip_2022$end_lat),ncol = 2))
```
* I often use View function to view the data  when i get  confused with      previewing the structure of the data but here i did'nt include the code    chunks
* **Unit conversion:**
    + Now i need to see the distance in km which was in metre
      and duration in minutes which was in seconds
```{r}
trip_2022$ride_distance =trip_2022$ride_distance/1000
trip_2022$ride_duration =trip_2022$ride_duration/60
```
* **Filtering the data:**
    + Now i need to drop the rows containing ride duration and ride              distance which are <= 0.This happened because there was no data with       respect to the location(name & coordinates) and time.

```{r}
 trip_2022_clean1 = trip_2022[ !(trip_2022$ride_duration <= 0 | trip_2022$ride_distance <= 0),]  
```
* **Previewing:**
    + Here i am going to view the dataset and structure of the dataset
```{r}
View(trip_2022_clean1)
str(trip_2022_clean1)
```
#### **4) ANALYZE AND SHARE:**

##### **5) ACT :**

<br>

* **FINDINGS OF MY ANALYSIS:**
    + Members Ride More No Of Times Than Casuals .
    + Mean  Ride Distance Was Almost Same For Both Casuals And Members
    + Mean Ride Duration Of Casuals Was More Than The Members.
    + In Weekdays Members Ride More Than The Casuals And In Weekends Almost
      Both Are Same.
    + Casuals And Members Rides More In Summer Season Which Is Late April        To Late October And There Was Hardly No Rides In Winter By Casuals         And Members.
